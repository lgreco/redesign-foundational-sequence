    The stack file is created (empty) the moment a FileStack is
    instantiated, so every other method can assume it already exists.

    push() appends a line to the stack file -- the same "add to the
    end" operation FileQueue's enqueue() uses, since the newest item
    belongs at the bottom of the file either way. pop() is where a
    stack and a queue diverge: the item to remove is the *last* line,
    not the first, and a sequential reader has no way to know a line
    is last until it tries to read the next one and finds nothing
    there. pop() therefore reads one line ahead of the line it is
    about to commit to the temp file -- once readline() comes back
    empty, whatever line is still being held is the last line, and
    that is the one popped rather than copied over. The temp file
    then becomes the stack file -- self._filename and
    self._temp_filename simply swap names, so the old stack file
    becomes next pop's temp file in turn. Two files ever exist on
    disk; which one is "the stack" alternates between them instead of
    being renamed.
