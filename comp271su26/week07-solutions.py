# Week 7 Solutions -- O(1) Middle Nodes, Continuity, and Loops in a Doubly
# Linked List
#
# All five stubs from double_linked_list.py are implemented below:
#   1. get_middle_node         -- the middle node, in O(1)
#   2. is_continuous            -- detect a broken link in a bidirectional list
#   3. has_loop_unidirectional  -- loop detection on a forward-only list, O(1)
#   4. has_loop_bidirectional   -- loop detection on a bidirectional ring, O(1)
#   5. reverse                  -- reverse a forward-only list, in O(n)
#
# __init__ and add() also changed from the stub file -- both were extended
# with the bookkeeping get_middle_node needs, exactly as the stub's docstring
# said would be necessary. Nothing about __str__, get_middle_slow_fast, or
# has_loop changed.
#
# main() below builds several deliberately unusual fixtures (a broken link,
# a forward-only loop, a bidirectional ring) by reaching into Node objects
# directly with set_next/set_prev. Ordinary code should never build a
# DoubleLinkedList that way; it is done here only so the methods above have
# something interesting to detect.
